# subscribe-to-message

** Add button to profile page if messaging is not enabled **

Add a button to the user card and user profile under the other buttons (e.g., "Message", "Chat", etc...) unless the user can send PMs.

The Button Text is customizable in the Theme Settings.

Clicking the button takes the user to the URL in the Button URL theme setting.

Thanks to the [Grey Arrows Drone Club](https://greyarro.ws/) for funding development of this theme component.
